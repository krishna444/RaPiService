# RaPiService
Spring based sample program to get the System and memory information from a Raspberry Pi device. The program runs as a web-service, we need to write a consumer to consume the service.

Its a gradle based spring boot project and we can direcly create a executable jar file and run. 

or if we want to deploy into a servlet container, we have to create WAR file before we deploy it intto a container.(Tomcat, for example)



**This program should be run or deployed on the RaPi device.**
